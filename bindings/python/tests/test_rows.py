"""The analytic row plane, decoded.

No binary and no library: the plane's contract is `contract/surface.toml`
lowered into `schema.gen.py`, so every expectation here is read off that table
rather than off a captured answer. Synthesized value arrays stand in for the
`irgx_value` blocks a cursor would hand over, which is the only way to test
absence, an unknown ordinal, and batch boundaries deliberately.

The properties under test are the ones a mis-decode would quietly violate:

  * **absent is not zero** — `distance = 0.0` means *identical*, so a cleared
    presence bit has to arrive as something else entirely;
  * **an unnamed ordinal stays unnamed** — a library ahead of this table must not
    be rounded down to the nearest label it does happen to know;
  * **nested rows recurse** — a quotation carries its phrases;
  * **a drifted schema table is fatal**, because the alternative is a plausible
    lie in every later row;
  * **decoded records outlive the cursor**, since the native rows they came from
    borrow an arena that is freed underneath them.
