"""The subprocess tier, rebuilt as rows.

The CLI is the fallback rung, and it will stay one: it is the only transport that
works against a library this Python was never built beside, and its answer is the
same answer. What changed is that it no longer has its own decoder. `rows()`
lifts a `--json` object into the same positional `Row` the C cursor produces, so
the seventeen hand-written NDJSON readers collapse into one schema walk.

Two things the wire cannot express by itself:

  * **A missing key is an absent field, not a zero.** The presence mask is
    reconstructed from which keys the object actually carries, which is what lets
    a `distance` of 0.0 keep meaning *identical* on this tier too.
  * **A label the table does not know stays unknown.** An enum label is resolved
    to its ordinal through the contract; an unrecognized one is handed on as an
    out-of-range ordinal so the decoder reports it rather than guessing.

`_KEYS` is the only place CLI spelling is written down. It exists because the
human-facing JSON was named for a reader (`bytes`, `in`) before the row schemas
were named for a decoder; every entry is a rename, never a reshaping.
