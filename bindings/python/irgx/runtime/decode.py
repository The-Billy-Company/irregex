"""One decoder for every analytic row the kernel can emit.

The engine no longer hands Python a verb-shaped JSON object; it hands back a
positional `irgx_value` array plus a schema id, and `contract/table.py` says
what the positions mean. So this module is the *whole* decode layer — seventeen
verbs, twenty-two row types, one walk — and adding a verb to the contract costs
zero Python.

Three things here are load-bearing rather than plumbing:

  * **Absent is not zero.** A row carries a presence mask; bit *i* clear means
    field *i* was never measured. For `distance` that distinction is the whole
    answer, because `0.0` means *identical*. `Row.masked` folds the mask into
    `ABSENT`, and an absent optional field falls to its declared default — an
    absent *required* field is a kernel bug and raises.
  * **An unknown enum ordinal stays unknown.** A library newer than this table
    can send an ordinal past the end of `ENUMS[name]`. Guessing the nearest
    variant would silently mislabel a grade, so the field decodes to `Unknown`,
    which compares equal to nothing and prints as `grade#7`.
  * **Row types are grown from the table, not written out.** `record` resolves a
    schema to a frozen `slots=True` dataclass built from its fields; `mixin`
    grafts domain behavior onto one by name. A verb module that already owns a
    public row type registers it with `bind`, which fails at import if its
    fields have drifted from the contract.
