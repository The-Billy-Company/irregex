"""The kernel's declared surface, mirrored — never restated.

Everything a caller can rely on that is *decided in the contract* rather than in
Python: the ABI and engine versions, the request options and exit codes
(`abi`), the calibration bands a distance or a coding gain is graded against
(`grades`), and the analytic row-schema table the decoder walks (`table`).

`../schema.gen.py` is lowered from `contract/analytic.toml` by
`tools/build_schema_tables.py` and stays where the generator puts it; `table` loads it and adds the
indexes a decoder needs. Nothing in this package computes a threshold — Zig owns
calibration, and a second opinion here would be a second answer.
