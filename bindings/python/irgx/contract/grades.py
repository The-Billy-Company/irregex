"""The kinship calibration, importable — a Python mirror of `src/kernel/kinship/metric/channel.zig`.

A distance is not an answer. `similar` returning 0.7813 *looks* like a result,
but it sits past the line where kinship stops meaning "related" and starts
meaning "both files are Zig". The CLI tells a human so on stderr; a library
caller cannot read stderr, so the same calibration lives here as values:

  * `Channel` — which kinship question is being asked, named for what it finds
    rather than the metric behind it. Both vocabularies parse (`--as copies` and
    `--lens bytes` are one channel), so a caller who learned the CLI is never
    stranded.
  * `Grade` — where a score falls on that channel's bands, so a caller can tell
    a real twin from statistical background without memorizing cut points.

Polarity differs by channel and is load-bearing: `copies`/`shapes`/`any` score a
DISTANCE (lower is closer) while `twins` scores a GAP and `recall` a coding GAIN
(higher is stronger), so one threshold spelling for all three would silently
invert. `score()`, `quantity`, and `grade_of()` make that explicit rather than
remembered — which is also why a row's score column is *named* for its polarity.

The bands are the engine's, not a second opinion: `tests/test_grade_parity.py`
reads `channel.zig` and asserts every cut point and alias matches.
