"""The analytic plane: one dispatch, one row cursor, one ladder.

Seventeen verbs used to mean seventeen subprocess spawns and seventeen NDJSON
parsers. They now mean one C call — `gist_run(engine, op, params)` —
returning a cursor of self-describing rows that `decode` turns into records.

**Five parameter families, not seventeen argument lists.** A caller learns one
struct per *kind* of question (`Kinship`, `Retrieval`, `Sweep`, `Compose`,
`Rank`), and the contract says which family a verb takes — checked here, so a
verb can never be dispatched with the wrong struct. Thresholds carry presence
flags because `0.0` is a meaningful threshold: `max_distance=0.0` means
byte-identical only, and "unset" cannot be spelled as zero.

**The ladder is invisible.** `answer()` tries the in-process plane and falls to
the `cold` continuation when the library is absent, the schema table disagrees,
the roots are not this process's, or the engine returns `IRREGEX_STALE` — the
kernel's way of saying *"ask the tier below"*. Both tiers produce the same rows
through the same decoder, so only the latency differs. A hard status (`OOM`,
`INVALID`) is a bug in this layer's marshaling rather than a query the kernel
declined, so it raises instead of quietly answering slower.

**Rows outlive their pull.** Unlike the exact cursor, an analytic answer is
materialized into one arena that stays valid until `close`, so batching costs
nothing and a caller may hold every batch at once. Records are decoded into
owned Python objects on the way out anyway, which is what makes `drain()` safe
after the cursor is gone.
