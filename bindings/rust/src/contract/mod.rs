//! Runtime mirror of the substrate contracts — `irregex/contract/engine.toml`,
//! `irregex/contract/analytic.toml`, and `relate/contract/kinship.toml` — plus
//! the result records both planes report. Gist's `contract/surface.toml`
//! still owns transports / tool-boundary / package names; those constants are
//! mirrored here so a parity gate can hold the whole surface in one place.
//!
//! The package embeds the contracts' load-bearing constants so it carries no
//! runtime dependency on the repo files (an OSS checkout ships without them); the
//! crate's parity test reads the canonical TOML and asserts this mirror matches
//! it — the standard registry-as-contract shape, so the two cannot silently
//! drift from the engine.
//!
//! The analytic plane's row-schema table is not hand-mirrored at all: it is
//! lowered from `analytic.toml` into [`schema`] by
//! `irregex/tools/build_schema_tables.py`, and [`crate::runtime`] walks it to
//! decode every analytic row.
