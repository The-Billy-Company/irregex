//! Transports, the fallback ladder, and the crate's typed failures.
//!
//! Every face of this crate asks its question here, and `runtime` decides *how*
//! it gets answered:
//!
//! | tier | when |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`plane`] — the in-process analytic C ABI | the symbols are present and the schema digest agrees |
//! | [`relay`] — the certified CLIs, NDJSON in | always; the fail-open floor |
//! | [`shell`] / [`session`] — the exact plane's process + resident transports | the rg-parity search surface |
//!
//! The ladder is **fail-open by construction**. `IRGX_STALE` is a
//! *declinature*, not a failure: the tier is saying "ask the next one and you
//! will get the same answer", so it never reaches the caller as an `Err`. The
//! same is true of an absent analytic symbol — an engine built before the analytic plane
//! landed simply has no in-process plane, and the crate keeps working.
//!
//! Exactly two things are loud. A **schema digest mismatch** ([`Error::SchemaDrift`])
//! means the library's row tables and this build's decoder disagree, so falling
//! back would hide a real version skew; and a **row that contradicts its own
//! declaration** ([`Error::Decode`]) is corruption, not a miss.
