//! gist T4 — result ranking via weighted Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF).
//!
//! The lexical tiers (T0–T2) answer *which files contain the match* as an
//! unordered set. An agent doesn't want a set — it wants the **one** line that
//! answers the question first (the *definition* of a symbol, not its 200 call
//! sites), and it pays tokens for every line below that. T4 turns the verified
//! match set into a ranked list.
//!
//! RRF (Cormack et al. 2009) is the right fusion primitive here, not a hand-tuned
//! linear score: it needs no per-signal normalization (it consumes *ranks*, not
//! raw magnitudes), is robust to one signal's blowups, and trivially admits new
//! signals. score(d) = Σ_i wᵢ / (k + rankᵢ(d)). We fuse four intrinsic signals
//! computed from the matches themselves —
//!   • **lexical** density (more occurrences ⇒ more relevant),
//!   • **symbol** boost (parser-free structural confidence that the match names
//!     a declaration rather than occurring inside one),
//!   • **shape rarity** (relate-style normalized match geometry; repeated call /
//!     import shapes carry less information than a rare explanatory shape),
//!   • **shallow path** (fewer path segments ⇒ closer to a package root, usually
//!     more central than a deep test/vendor file),
//!   • **authored** boost (codegen output and cached source mirrors are demoted:
//!     they win lexical *and* symbol yet are never the agent's edit target, so
//!     without this they flood the head on common symbols; weighted to outrank
//!     that double boost),
//! — plus an **optional external ranking** (`graph_rank`): pass any
//! graph-centrality order and it fuses in for free; pass null and it's ignored.
//! Embeddings stay deliberately out (CoREB: short keyword queries collapse them).
