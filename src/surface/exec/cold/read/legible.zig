//! gist `rg` — raw bytes made legible to the matcher.
//!
//! Two steps, one answer to "what is actually being searched": the bytes are
//! normalized into matchable UTF-8 (the `auto` encoding leg `ingest.zig`
//! dispatches to — BOM sniff, UTF-16 transcode; explicit WHATWG labels go to
//! `encoding.zig` instead), then split under ripgrep's line model. That split
//! is THE definition of where a line starts and whether a trailing terminator
//! makes another — shared by both walk engines, the binary quit strategy
//! (`binary.zig`), and the warm face, so none of them can drift on the unit
//! every other per-file decision is expressed in.
