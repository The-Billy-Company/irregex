//! Personal preferences — the reader's half of what outlives an invocation.
//!
//! The charter (`corpus/scope/charter.zig`) says what the TREE is, and it is
//! committed because that fact is everyone's. This file is the opposite kind of
//! thing: what one person likes to look at. `--heading`, `-n`, `--max-columns`,
//! `--smart-case`. It is machine-local, it is never committed, and nobody else
//! is affected by it.
//!
//! Which is exactly why ripgrep's version of this is dangerous and gist's is
//! not. A `.ripgreprc` applies to every invocation, so a `--smart-case` in it
//! silently changes what a colleague's script matches on your machine and not on
//! theirs — the reason `--no-config` had to be invented, and the reason an agent
//! is expected to pass it. Here, preferences apply **only when stdout is an
//! interactive terminal**. That is not a new rule bolted on: it is the envelope
//! boundary gist already draws everywhere else. The answer keep declines on a
//! TTY (`surface/cli/reprise.zig`), the resident daemon declines on a TTY, color
//! resolves on a TTY. Riding the same line means a pipe, a redirect, `--json`, a
//! script, CI, the daemon, and an agent are all structurally outside this file's
//! reach, and none of them ever needs `--no-config` to be sure of it.
//!
//! Two smaller repairs of the same feature:
//!
//!   * Lines are TOKENIZED, with shell quoting. ripgrep's are verbatim argv
//!     elements, so `--glob '!.git/*'` puts literal quote characters into the
//!     glob and silently matches nothing — the single most-reported confusion
//!     about that file (#927, #932, #2646, #3428). Here a quote is a quote.
//!   * Every flag is checked against the catalog as the file is read, naming
//!     the file and line. A typo is a loud error at the top of the run rather
//!     than a mystery in the middle of it.
