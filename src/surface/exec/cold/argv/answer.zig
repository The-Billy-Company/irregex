//! The shape the answer takes — decided once, before anything prints.
//!
//! `intent.zig` holds what was asked; this holds what comes back. The two are
//! deliberately separate concepts: a dozen presentation flags argue over one
//! question ("is this run answering with file content, a path list, a tally, or
//! a JSON stream?"), and that argument has exactly one right answer per run.
//!
//! ripgrep settles it with a single `Mode` under a last-wins rule and treats
//! every *other* presentation flag (`-o`, `--passthru`, `--vimgrep`,
//! `--heading`, `--column`, …) as an orthogonal printer option that never
//! competes for the mode slot. gist used to model all of them as co-equal
//! booleans on `Opts` and re-derive the precedence inside each emit dispatcher —
//! `grid.zig` and `multibuf.zig` each owned a private `and !o.count_only and
//! !o.files_only …` ladder. Two ladders, one contract, no compiler holding them
//! to it: they drifted. An ordered-pair differential sweep against rg (every
//! shaping flag crossed with every other, rg as the oracle) found the drift as
//! ~18 interaction divergences, worst around `--heading` and `--vimgrep`.
//!
//! So the precedence lives here, once, and printers consume the verdict instead
//! of re-litigating it. Mutually exclusive modes become unrepresentable rather
//! than merely discouraged: there is no state in which `-l` and `-c` are both
//! "on", because there is only one field.
