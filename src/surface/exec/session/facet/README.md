# `facet/` — the four faces one warm answer can wear

Each module here takes the candidate documents [`../answer/gather.zig`](../answer/gather.zig)
produced and turns them into one shape: a set, a count, finished bytes, or a
record stream. They are siblings rather than one switch because they differ in
what they _accumulate_, not in how they walk — the walk is shared, which is why
no two faces can prune differently or disagree about which document is live.

| ---------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [`fold.zig`](fold.zig)       | a set / a count | The fold face — a **set** of paths (`-l`) or a **count** of matching lines (`-c`), sharded over cores above the parallel floor. `-v` is answered as the set-complement `lines(f) − matching(f)` so the trigram index stays sound and only candidate files run the matcher.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [`present.zig`](present.zig) | finished bytes  | The rendered faces: the default `path:text` line search, its shared-memory sibling above the transport floor (same bytes, different carrier), and the gist-native definition-first `--rank` view.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [`stream.zig`](stream.zig)   | records         | The per-line faces: the in-process FFI's `MatchRecord` stream (rg's line model, `-A`/`-B`/`-C` context windows, the `-m` cap, parallel shards reassembled in doc order) and the early-halting `-q` existence probe that stops at the first admitted match. Owns `LineWalk`, the single line-splitting authority.                                                                                                                                       |
| [`render.zig`](render.zig)   | the byte frame  | The warm `lines` renderer: the default `path:text` / `-n` `path:line:text` frame, produced through the cold engine's **own** `Emitter` + `grepfile.handleBinary` — byte-parity by construction, never a re-derived formatter. Also home to `fanRender` + the `par_min_bytes` floor: above it every warm face shards its scan over cores through the one shared `kernel/primitives/parallel.zig` primitive, byte-identical to the serial core below it. |

`render_test.zig` sits beside its subject.

## Nothing here invents a format

`present.zig` formats nothing itself: it gathers warm documents and hands them to
a renderer the **cold** path owns — `render.zig` (which drives the cold engine's
own `Emitter`) for the default presentation, `ranked.renderLive` for `--rank`. So
byte-parity with a piped cold run is a property of construction rather than of a
second formatter that could drift from the first.

## One line model, counted once

`\n` **terminates** a line — a body ending in `\n` has no phantom final line.
The `-q` probe, the record stream, the context planner, and
`corpus.gatedLineCount` all count that same split through `LineWalk`, so none of
them can drift from the others by re-deriving the walk locally.
