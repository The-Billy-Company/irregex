//! gist resident session — the warm, in-memory search engine (ADR-352 rung 2.5).
//!
//! A `ResidentSession` owns the corpus bytes + trigram index for one repository,
//! held warm across many queries so an eligible request (`request.zig`) answers
//! without re-paying the process + index-mmap + candidate-read startup the cold
//! subprocess pays every call. It lowers each request through the shared search
//! core (`kernel/match/query/query.zig`) — the SAME compile → trigram-prefilter → match
//! kernels the cold CLI is built on — driven directly over the warm corpus, so
//! the warm and cold answers cannot drift. Because that core **returns errors**
//! (`error.Unsupported`) instead of calling `die()`, a bad request declines with
//! `freshness_unprovable` (→ cold fallback) and can never terminate the daemon — the
//! exact hazard ADR-352 defers the C FFI on.
//!
//! ## The corpus is a faithful mirror
//!
//! Base docs load through `corpus.zig` as a TWO-TIER byte store: an unchanged
//! member binds its bytes to the persisted `content.shard` mmap (zero heap,
//! page-cache-evictable), and only a changed/new/binary/oversize/BOM-carrying
//! doc — or the whole corpus when no shard is on disk — heap-reads. Either tier
//! yields the SAME faithful ingest a cold run applies: full body (no cap),
//! BOM/UTF-16 decode, whole-body first-NUL offsets, empty docs dropped, so
//! resident heap drops from O(corpus) to O(churn + exceptions) with no answer
//! drift. Binary docs are ADMITTED (cold does not skip a walked
//! binary; it searches up to the buffer that revealed the first NUL), and each
//! mode applies cold's own binary rule at answer time:
//!
//!   - `files` (`-l`): match only within complete buffers before the NUL one
//!     (`binary.handleBinary`'s files_only policy).
//!   - `count` (`-c`): an implicit binary file is suppressed entirely.
//!   - `lines` (bare `gist <pattern>`): emit pre-NUL-buffer matches + WARNING,
//!     rendered by `render.zig` through the cold Emitter itself.
//!   - `search` (FFI record stream): a doc cold `--json` would skip (its 8 KiB
//!     `isBinary` window) is skipped, keeping the record stream byte-identical.
//!
//! ## Read-your-writes: a fail-closed reconcile barrier
//!
//! The invariant is `resident matches == gist --no-index matches == rg matches`.
//! It holds because both the base corpus and every reconcile re-derive their file
//! set from the cold path's OWN certified walk (`surface/exec/cold/engine/serial.zig::
//! defaultFileSet` — hidden-file exclusion, `.gitignore`/`.ignore` precedence,
//! `.git` skip, root scope), never `haystack`'s coarse superset. The warm set is
//! therefore byte-identical to what a rootless `gist <pattern>` would walk:
//!
//!   - A query is answered from resident bytes directly ONLY when the freshness
//!     barrier proves the roots quiescent since the last reconcile — a
//!     watcher-clean window (`markClean`/`markDirty`, driven by inotify on Linux
//!     / kqueue on macOS; `src/surface/exec/session/watch/watch.zig`). This is the microsecond path.
//!   - Otherwise (no watcher, any pending event, first query) the session
//!     RECONCILES: it re-walks the authoritative set and diffs it against
//!     base + overlay — a path that left the set (deleted, or newly
//!     hidden/ignored) is tombstoned; a new path is read in; a known path whose
//!     mtime/ctime advanced past the freshness cursor is re-read — then answers
//!     over (base ∪ overlay) − tombstones. Fail-closed: a rebuilt index
//!     (`pair.gen` drift), a reconcile allocation failure, or a WALK ERROR (an
//!     unreadable directory — cold reports it and exits 2, so a warm answer over
//!     a silently gapped set would lie) declines with `freshness_unprovable`, so
//!     the client falls back to the certified cold path. (A
//!     catastrophic OOM inside the shared walk itself exits the daemon via
//!     `die()`; the client's dropped connection then falls back cold and the
//!     next query re-spawns a fresh daemon — fail-open too.)
//!
//! Concurrent reads overlap under a shared `Ward` lease
//! (`kernel/primitives/ward.zig`) while a reconcile runs alone under the
//! exclusive lease; the watcher only ever touches the shared `Seqlock`
//! (`seqlock.zig`), never the overlay, so the barrier is a lock-free seqlock
//! over a ward-guarded engine.
//!
//! ## Where the engine lives
//!
//! This file owns the session's STATE — the mirror + index it binds at `init`,
//! the overlay and freshness fields, and `beginRead`, the lease every answer
//! passes through. The behavior lives in siblings, bound back into the struct by
//! the decl table at its foot, so a caller still writes `sess.query(...)`:
//!
//!   - `answer.zig` — the answer + budget vocabulary, re-exported below.
//!   - `overlay.zig` — the mutation store: substitutions, tombstones, twins.
//!   - `reconcile.zig` — the fail-closed barrier + the `-t`/`-g` extras guard.
//!   - `gather.zig` — compile, trigram prune, and the candidate walk every face shares.
//!   - `fold.zig` — the `-l`/`-c` set/count face and its `-v` complement.
//!   - `present.zig` — the rendered faces: `lines`, its shm sibling, `--rank`.
//!   - `stream.zig` — the FFI record stream and the `-q` existence probe.
