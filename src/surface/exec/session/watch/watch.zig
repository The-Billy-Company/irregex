//! gist resident session — the freshness watcher (ADR-352 rung 2.5).
//!
//! The watcher is a pure *accelerator* for the freshness barrier, never a
//! correctness dependency. Its only job is to keep a session honest about when
//! it may skip the reconcile walk: on any filesystem event under the watched
//! roots it calls `session.markDirty()`, forcing the next query to reconcile;
//! when it has proven no event since the last reconcile the session takes the
//! microsecond fast path. If a watcher cannot be started (unsupported platform,
//! a watch that won't register, a descriptor budget that won't fit), the session
//! is simply **never armed** — `watcher_active` stays false and every query
//! reconciles the changed set against the live filesystem. Correctness rests on
//! that reconcile (`resident.zig`), so a missing or degraded watcher only costs
//! speed, never soundness (fail-closed).
//!
//! Backends: Linux `inotify` and macOS `kqueue` (`EVFILT_VNODE`). Both post
//! their event inside the syscall that caused it, which is what makes
//! drain-to-empty (`flushSync`) a genuine happens-before witness and lets each
//! arm `DirtyLog.exact` — the promise that unlocks the O(changed) scoped
//! reconcile. Every other target keeps the reconcile-always baseline. A rootless
//! session watches `.` — the same CWD tree its corpus walks.
//!
//! Both backends `note` every changed path into the session's `DirtyLog`, so
//! reconcile verifies only changed paths — O(changed) instead of O(tree). An
//! unattributable event becomes `noteDoubt`, forcing one full walk; coverage
//! that cannot be re-established calls `markDoubtForever`, retiring the fast
//! path for the session's life (fail-closed). Notes are keyed to absolute
//! realpaths, the canonical shape `delta.resolve` expects.
//!
//! The two differ in what they must refuse, because their event KEY SPACES
//! differ. inotify reports a parent watch descriptor plus a kernel-supplied
//! name, so a casefolded root (ext4/f2fs `+F`) would alias distinct
//! byte-spellings the exact key model cannot represent — such a session stays
//! coarse. kqueue reports a DESCRIPTOR this process opened itself, with the
//! walk's own canonical spelling, so a writer's choice of spelling never enters
//! the key space and exact arms even on a case-insensitive volume (ADR-372).
//! inotify must also watch for a queue overflow and for directories created
//! after arming, since its watches neither recurse nor coalesce; kqueue has no
//! queue to overflow (events fold into a knote's `fflags`) but must still extend
//! coverage into new entries, and must hold one descriptor per watched vnode.
//!
//! That descriptor-per-vnode price is why the macOS set is selected by the
//! WALK'S OWN admission policy (`corpus/tree/ignore.zig`), not by the raw tree:
//! inotify watches directories and gets their entries named for free, while
//! keeping gitignored files on macOS cost 193k descriptors against 25k admitted
//! ones here. The set therefore also carries the hidden per-directory ignore
//! SOURCES that decide admission, and a change to one re-derives both the rules
//! and the set (`refreshCoverage` via `Cover.refresh`) — otherwise a rule edit
//! could admit a file that nothing was watching.
//!
//! The same price makes the budget a question about the WHOLE MACHINE, not just
//! this process: `watchBudget` clamps against the ceiling Darwin actually
//! enforces (`kern.maxfilesperproc`, which `getrlimit` never reports) and
//! against a bounded share of the live system file table, so declining is
//! predictive rather than an `EMFILE` discovered halfway through registration.
//! And because a watch set only earns its keep while somebody is querying, it
//! is RELEASABLE: `shed` hands every descriptor back and returns the session to
//! the reconcile-always baseline, `start` re-registers it. That is what lets an
//! idle daemon stop taxing the commons its siblings share (`serve.zig`'s
//! two-stage idle policy) without ever risking a stale answer.
//!
//! The backends live beside this facade under `watch/`: `inotify.zig` (Linux),
//! `kqueue.zig` (macOS events) + `coverage.zig` (the macOS admission walk) +
//! `budget.zig` (the descriptor ceiling). Each is a set of free functions over
//! the generic `Watcher(Session)` below; this file owns the shared state, the
//! comptime backend selection, and the cross-backend invariants documented here.
