//! gist resident session — the macOS kqueue coverage walk (ADR-352 rung 2.5,
//! ADR-372).
//!
//! macOS pays one DESCRIPTOR per watched file, so — unlike Linux, which watches
//! whole directories and gets their entries named for free — the watch set must
//! be exactly the set the corpus admits, or a single daemon holds 40% of the
//! system file table. This module selects that set from the SAME `Ignore`
//! policy the corpus walk and `delta` use, over the same roots: `coverTree`
//! descends precisely what the certified walk would descend and searches, plus
//! the hidden ignore SOURCES that decide both. It owns the arena the policy
//! lives in (`loadPolicy`/`dropPolicy`) and the key-space arithmetic
//! (`joinKey`/`rootKeyOf`). Registration itself and the event loop live in
//! `kqueue.zig`; the shared accelerator contract lives in the `watch.zig`
//! facade.
