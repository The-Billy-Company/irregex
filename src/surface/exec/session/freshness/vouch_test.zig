//! gist resident session — the epoch's vouch, driven on whichever exact backend
//! the platform actually ships.
//!
//! The answer keep rests on one borrowed premise: two runs reading the same
//! epoch saw the same corpus. Neither side of that sentence is tested by the
//! suites that own the two halves. `keep.zig` is handed an epoch and does
//! honest bookkeeping under it — offered 7 and 8 by hand, it cannot know
//! whether the tree moved between them. `annals.zig` arms its own ledger and
//! feeds itself synthetic `note` calls — it proves the arithmetic, never that
//! anything real drives it. The premise lives in the gap between: a backend
//! that must arm the ledger, deliver into it, and surrender it correctly.
//!
//! Three bugs lived in that gap, and all were invisible to every existing test.
//! `inotify` armed the seqlock and the dirty log and never armed the annals, so
//! `epoch()` answered null and the keep was silently dead on every Linux daemon
//! — unreachable by a suite that arms the ledger by hand, and unreachable by
//! `kqueue_test.zig`, which boots a real watcher but is macOS-only by
//! construction. And losing coverage poisoned only the seqlock: reconciling
//! kept protecting the QUERY while the stamp stood still under a moving tree,
//! so an answer already HELD read fresh indefinitely. The same shape hid once
//! more on the macOS side, where an event that named no watch of ours raised
//! doubt in the dirty log alone and left the ledger vouching an epoch it had
//! never counted that change into.
//!
//! So this file grades the premise itself, against a real watcher over a real
//! tree, on macOS and Linux alike:
//!
//!   1. LIVENESS — a backend that arms exact must vouch an epoch. Everything
//!      above this is correct without it; the warm tier is just quietly gone.
//!   2. SAFETY — across a randomized mutation sequence, two samples reading the
//!      same non-null epoch must have read the same bytes. Only that direction
//!      is asserted: an epoch that moves without a content change is merely
//!      conservative, and costs a recompute rather than correctness.
//!   3. SURRENDER — the two ways coverage ends. Lost coverage must make the
//!      epoch decline outright; a deliberate shed must move it past anything
//!      held under the retiring stream. Both are graded THROUGH the keep,
//!      because a bit on a struct is not the hazard — a served stale answer is.
//!   4. DOUBT — coverage survives, but one delivery could not be placed. The
//!      ledger must lose the WHICH and still count the WHETHER, because this is
//!      the one shape where neither protection holds alone: the reconcile's full
//!      walk saves the QUERY and does nothing for an answer already held.
//!
//! The oracle never runs the engine: it is a re-read of the fixture's own live
//! ledger, so a backend bug cannot grade its own homework (sins.mdc Sin #2).
