//! Shared CLI vocabulary — the stderr guidance grammar.
//!
//! Every face owes the caller who got a useless answer an explanation on
//! stderr, in one grammar: an outcome line, then ranked suggestion lines
//! (`<tool>: try <flag or move> — <why>`) and explanatory lines
//! (`<tool>: note: <fact>`) — rustc's help/note split.
//!
//!     <exact>:   no matches for 'Pattern' · 1204 files scanned
//!     <exact>:   try -i — the pattern has uppercase; retry case-insensitive
//!     <kinship>: no strong kin for fresh.zig · nearest 0.7813 (weak)
//!     <kinship>: try --as shapes — byte kinship cannot see renamed vocabulary
//!
//! The exact face's no-match hints (`exec/cold/emit/hints.zig`) and the kinship
//! face's weak-result verdict (`grade.zig`) are the same channel wearing
//! different evidence, so the voice lives here once and each face passes its
//! own name.
//! Callers own the budget: hints are capped so a caller reads guidance
//! instead of scrolling it.
