//! gist resident session — the warm `lines` renderer.
//!
//! Renders the default `gist <pattern>` presentation (`path:text`, `-n` for
//! `path:line:text`) for a pre-gated, path-sorted document list — through the
//! cold engine's OWN `Emitter` and `binary.handleBinary`, not a re-derived
//! formatter. Byte-parity is therefore by construction: the same line split
//! (`collectLines`), the same binary policy (emit up to the buffer that
//! revealed the first NUL, then the implicit-file WARNING), the same
//! `--max-columns`/trim/terminator behavior (all at their defaults here — the
//! classifier admits no flag that changes them), the same rendering code.
//!
//! The eligible warm surface never reaches the presentation states that need
//! run-wide resolution in `run.zig`: the client declines a TTY stdout (color +
//! the interactive long-line cap), and context/heading/replace flags are
//! classifier-ineligible. Scoped requests derive explicit-file identity and
//! the run-wide filename prefix from their roots, matching cold's auto mode.
//! What remains is exactly the default piped frame, reproduced verbatim.
//!
//! Fail-closed like the rest of the session: a pattern the chosen engine
//! declines (the linear default, or the PCRE2 backend under `-P`) is
//! `error.Unsupported` (→ decline → certified cold answer), never
//! a `die()`. (The Emitter's own internal OOM `die` remains the documented
//! catastrophic-OOM fail-open: the daemon exits, the client's dropped
//! connection falls back cold.)
