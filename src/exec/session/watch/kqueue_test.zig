//! Resident session — what is macOS's alone about the kqueue barrier.
//!
//! The promises every exact backend makes — an in-place edit is seen, a newcomer
//! is covered for its later edits, a cross-directory move lands on both ends, a
//! case-only rename resolves to one spelling, a deletion stays gone, a served root
//! declines to scope and is right anyway, a shed set falls back to the baseline —
//! live in `watch_test.zig` and run over `rig.zig` on every backend that arms
//! exact. Duplicating them here would let one platform's copy drift.
//!
//! What is left is what only this backend has, and each case is a hazard the
//! design had to answer rather than a paraphrase of the code:
//!
//!   - the WATCH SET is selected by the walk's own ignore policy, because macOS
//!     pays one descriptor per file (25k admitted here against 193k with
//!     gitignored output kept). So an ignore-rule edit has to re-derive the
//!     policy AND the set — a fresh policy alone leaves a newly-admitted file
//!     unwatched, which answers staler than the disk while claiming clean.
//!   - a vnode it cannot OPEN is a delivery it cannot place, and one of those is
//!     enough to refuse the whole session. No other backend has this shape:
//!     inotify and `ReadDirectoryChangesW` both register against a directory and
//!     never open the entries.
//!
//! macOS-only by construction; every case returns immediately elsewhere.
