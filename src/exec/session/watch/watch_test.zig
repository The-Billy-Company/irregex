//! Resident session — the freshness-watcher barrier suite.
//!
//! The watcher is a pure *accelerator*: when it proves quiescence the session
//! takes the microsecond clean path; on any event it forces a reconcile. These
//! tests pin that barrier's two halves — an armed, event-free window flips
//! `clean` true (fast path) and a `markDirty` clears it (back to reconcile) —
//! and prove the real `Watcher` lifecycle (`start`/`stop`) is crash-free. All
//! three report-in-the-operation backends arm causal quiescence (Linux inotify ·
//! macOS kqueue · Windows `ReadDirectoryChangesW`); a target without one
//! stays reconcile-always.
//!
//! It then pins THE PROMISE ITSELF, over the real `Watcher` and a real tree
//! (`rig.zig`). Arming `DirtyLog.exact` is one contract whatever backend arms it,
//! so these cases belong to the facade rather than to a platform: each is a hazard
//! the design had to answer, and each runs unchanged on every backend in
//! `rig.live`, which is the only way two implementations can be held to one
//! promise. A backend's own peculiarities — macOS's descriptor-per-vnode coverage
//! walk, Windows' record-class negotiation — stay in `kqueue_test.zig` and
//! `notify_test.zig` beside it.
