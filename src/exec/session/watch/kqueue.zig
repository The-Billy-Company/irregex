//! Raw syscalls, no frameworks: the watcher costs the cold one-shot search
//! nothing, where the FSEvents stream this replaced needed CoreServices +
//! CoreFoundation (whose image initializers ran on every process launch, which
//! is why they were `dlopen`'d rather than linked). One `EVFILT_VNODE`
//! descriptor per watched vnode (selected by `coverage.zig`, capped by
//! `budget.zig`); this module registers them (`startKqueue`), drains their
//! events under the shared consumption lock (`drainKqueueLocked`), extends
//! coverage when a directory's membership moves, and retires a descriptor whose
//! vnode left. Every function takes the generic `Watcher(Session)` as `self`;
//! the shared accelerator contract and lifecycle live in the `watch.zig`
//! facade.
