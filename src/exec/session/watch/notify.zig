//! gist resident session — the Windows `ReadDirectoryChangesW` freshness backend
//!
//! One recursive subscription per root, every completion landing on a single I/O
//! completion port. Structurally this is the Linux arm, not the macOS one: a
//! `WatchTree` subscription covers a whole subtree *including directories created
//! after arming*, so there is no `coverNewDir` to write, no descriptor-per-vnode
//! price to predict, and no admission walk to keep in step with the ignore rules.
//! The port is the `inotify_fd` of this backend — one waitable object, drained to
//! empty under `read_lock` by whichever of the two consumers gets there first.
//!
//! **Why a completion port and not an event or an APC.** All three can report a
//! finished notify, and only one of them can carry the freshness *barrier*. An
//! event in the `IO_STATUS_BLOCK` and an APC are both delivered by the issuing
//! thread — the status block is written and the event signalled inside a special
//! kernel APC queued to whoever issued the request — so a `flushSync` running on
//! the daemon's route thread could scan every status block, find them all
//! `PENDING`, and declare a tree quiescent that the kernel had already reported
//! moving. That is precisely the stale answer the barrier exists to prevent. A
//! completion port is queued by the I/O manager to the PORT, outliving even the
//! issuing thread, so a drain from any thread is a genuine witness — which is what
//! lets this backend keep the same `flushSync` contract the POSIX two have.
//!
//! **What the barrier does and does not promise here, honestly.** Windows updates
//! a file's directory entry lazily: bytes written through a handle that is still
//! open change no entry and therefore raise no notification, however long you
//! wait. That sounds fatal to a fast path and is not, because the reconcile this
//! watcher accelerates reads *that same directory entry* — `reconcile.one` gates a
//! re-read on the `mtime`/`ctime` the enumerating walk captured, and on Windows
//! that walk is `NtQueryDirectoryFile` over the very entries these notifications
//! are raised from. So a write this backend cannot see is a write a full reconcile
//! would also have missed. Skipping the walk loses nothing that walking would have
//! found, which is the only promise the clean fast path actually makes. The
//! obligation that follows is concrete and is the reason `filter` is spelled as
//! widely as it is: **every field the reconcile compares must be in the filter**,
//! or the walk would notice something the watcher slept through.
//!
//! **Exact keys, without a case-sensitivity refusal.** inotify has to decline
//! `exact` on a casefolded directory because it reports a parent watch plus a
//! writer-supplied name, so two byte-spellings can alias one file. A notify record
//! carries the name *as the directory entry stores it* — one spelling per file, no
//! matter how the writer opened it — so the key space is the walk's own, exactly as
//! it is for kqueue's descriptors. Case-insensitive volumes and
//! per-directory case-sensitive ones both arm.
//!
//! **The extended record class earns its floor.** `NotifyExtended` (Windows 10
//! 1709, under the `win10_rs4` floor the resident tier already declares) puts the
//! file's attributes AND its timestamps in the record itself. That buys two things
//! no POSIX backend gets: a directory is told from a file with no `stat` at all,
//! and the annals ledger is stamped with the file's own `max(mtime, ctime)` — the
//! exact quantity `Annals.seed` documents as canonical — rather than with the
//! drain-time clock the other two must approximate it by. A filesystem that
//! refuses the class falls back to the plain one, where an unattributable kind is
//! treated as a file: one ledger entry the reader stats away, never a lost change.
//!
//! Every function takes the generic `Watcher(Session)` as `self`; the shared
//! accelerator contract and lifecycle live in the `watch.zig` facade.
