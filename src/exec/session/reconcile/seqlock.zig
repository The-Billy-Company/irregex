//! The freshness seqlock every resident session shares.
//!
//! Both warm engines — the exact face's `ResidentSession` (mirrors corpus
//! bytes) and the kinship face's `RetrievalSession` (caches an anchor overlay)
//! — face the identical concurrency problem: a watch thread reports filesystem
//! events while a query thread, under the session mutex, decides whether it may
//! skip the reconcile walk. The decision is a lock-free seqlock over three
//! atomics + one plain bool, and the memory ordering is subtle enough that it
//! must live in ONE place, not be re-derived per session. This is that place: it
//! owns every `.acquire`/`.release`/`.monotonic`, so no session ever touches a
//! raw atomic.
//!
//! The payload — what "reconcile" actually recomputes — stays per session; the
//! barrier only tracks *whether* a recompute is owed. The protocol:
//!
//!   - watch thread: `markDirty` on every event, `markDoubtForever` when it
//!     loses coverage it cannot recover (fail-closed — the fast path is then
//!     permanently off), `arm` once a backend is proven live, and `disarm` when
//!     it gives live coverage back on purpose (an idle daemon releasing its
//!     descriptors) — reversible, unlike doubt, but every query in the gap
//!     reconciles and the session owes a fresh covering pass before the scoped
//!     path can reopen.
//!   - query thread (holding the session mutex): `skip` short-circuits the walk
//!     when a live watcher has proven quiescence; otherwise snapshot `enter`,
//!     recompute, then `commit` — which republishes "clean" ONLY if no event
//!     raced the recompute (the seqlock re-read). Without a watcher, `clean` is
//!     never set, so every query reconciles: correct, just not microsecond-fast.
//!
//! `clean` is set true only under `eligible`, and any event (`markDirty`, and
//! `markDoubtForever` calls it) clears it, so `provenClean` — the raw bit the
//! answer paths read to decide whether a hit still needs an existence stat —
//! is a sound "no untracked change since the last reconcile" witness on its own.
