//! shm — a portable, anonymous, one-shot shared buffer for fd-passed emit.
//!
//! The warm daemon renders a large `lines` answer into ONE of these, hands the
//! client its fd over the socket's SCM_RIGHTS control channel (`wire.zig`), and
//! the client mmaps it read-only straight to stdout — so a multi-MB answer never
//! traverses the socket (no user→kernel→user copy of the payload bytes, only the
//! fd rides the wire). It backs the same finished bytes the `chunk` frames would
//! carry; nothing about how they're computed changes.
//!
//! Anonymous + bounded to the exact rendered length on both platforms:
//!   * Linux — `memfd_create` then, once the daemon's writable view is gone,
//!     sealed immutable (`F_SEAL_WRITE|SHRINK|GROW|SEAL`) so the client's view
//!     can never be resized or rewritten under it.
//!   * macOS — `shm_open(O_CREAT|O_EXCL)` on a unique name, `shm_unlink`ed
//!     IMMEDIATELY (the fd stays valid after unlink) so no name lingers in the
//!     global namespace for another process to open.
//!
//! Fail-open, and typed as such: every fallible call **declines** rather than
//! erroring, and the caller turns the declinature back into the classic
//! `chunk`-frame path. This buffer is a pure accelerator, never a new source of
//! truth or a new failure mode — which is exactly why "the shared buffer could
//! not be stood up" belongs on `fault.Answer`'s success channel (ADR-373 law 1)
//! and not in an error set a caller could `try` past into an abort.
