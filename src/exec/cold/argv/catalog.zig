//! The ripgrep flag surface, declared once.
//!
//! `flag_catalog` is a table, not code: one row per flag, naming its spellings,
//! its parse effect, and its compatibility claim. Two consumers read it and
//! neither may disagree with the other — `grammar.zig` builds the short/long
//! dispatch maps from it, and a face's own schema verb renders `--schema` from
//! it. A flag cannot therefore be accepted by the parser while the machine-
//! readable manifest calls it unsupported, or vice versa; that drift used to be
//! a prose-versus-behavior bug waiting to happen.
//!
//! Most rows are purely declarative: `.set`/`.unset`/`.set_num`/`.set_str` name
//! the `Opts` field they drive, and the `comptime` block below *proves* each
//! named field has the type its action assumes, so a typo'd or retyped field is
//! a compile error rather than an unreachable branch at runtime. Only the rows
//! that genuinely need behavior (precedence, multi-value accumulation, optional
//! inline values) carry a named action for `grammar.apply` to interpret.
