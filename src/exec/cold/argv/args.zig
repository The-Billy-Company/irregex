//! The `rg` face — the ripgrep-compatible CLI flag surface (parsing only).
//!
//! This file is the argv package's **interface**: the names the rest of the tree
//! may use, and nothing else. Thirty-odd modules — every engine, emitter, face
//! verb, and the FFI session — import exactly this path, so what they depend on
//! is this list rather than the grammar's internals, and the package can be
//! re-cut underneath them without a single call-site edit.
//!
//! Split from `run.zig` (the walk + match + emit shell) the same way the grep
//! verb's `args.zig` splits from its `emit.zig`: this package owns the argv →
//! `Opts` lowering and the type/glob `Filter`, and nothing about IO or matching.
//! It implements ripgrep's DEFAULT flag semantics — short-flag bundling, `--flag`
//! and `--flag=value`, `-A/-B` precedence over `-C`, the `-u/-uu` unrestrict
//! tiers, `-t/-T/-g/--glob/--iglob` scoping with `!`-exclude + leading-`/`
//! anchoring. We now accept or honor the entire rg flag surface — the
//! fail-loud bucket is empty. `flag_catalog` is the parser and `--schema`
//! compatibility source of truth.
//!
//! Six implementation modules, each owning one axis of "what was asked for":
//!
//!   * [`intent.zig`](intent.zig)       — the request: `Opts`, `Filter`, `Parsed`,
//!                       and the `Builder` that accumulates them while argv arrives
//!   * [`catalog.zig`](catalog.zig)     — `flag_catalog`: every flag declared once,
//!                       as the table both the parser and `--schema` read
//!   * [`grammar.zig`](grammar.zig)     — the walk: bundling, `=value`, and every
//!                       precedence rule that can only settle after argv ends
//!   * [`verdict.zig`](verdict.zig)     — what a flag's value may be, and the exit-2
//!                       it earns when it isn't that
//!   * [`shape.zig`](shape.zig)        — the `Mode` a run resolves to and its
//!                       last-wins precedence over the presentation flags
//!   * [`preference.zig`](preference.zig) — personal preferences (machine-local,
//!                       TTY-gated, catalog-validated)
//!
//! Nothing here re-implements; the aliases below are the package's whole public
//! vocabulary. `Act`, `Builder`, `setVal`, and the value decoders are absent on
//! purpose — they are how the package works, not what it offers.
