//! The native-lens dispatch — our own ways of looking at a match, as opposed
//! to ripgrep's.
//!
//! A **lens** answers the same compiled query over the same PATH scope, but
//! presents it in a shape `rg` has no flag for. Each one branches BEFORE the
//! certified rg-parity walk/emit path and finishes the run itself, which is
//! what keeps the parity certificate intact: a lens cannot thread its own
//! awareness through the machinery rgsuite measures, because it never reaches
//! it. Two ship today — `--rank` (definition-first RRF) and
//! `--in-comments`/`--in-code` (comment/code-scoped matches).
//!
//! `dispatch` is the single seam. This used to be two `if` blocks with their
//! orchestration written inline in `serial.run`; a third lens would have been a
//! third block, each re-deriving the file set, the filename-visibility rule,
//! and the exit shape by hand. Written once here, adding a lens is adding a
//! case — not re-deriving the run (the cold-engine deep-module split).
