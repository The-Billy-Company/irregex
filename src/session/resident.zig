// MONOLITHIC: warm-session engine — the freshness seqlock, reconcile overlay, and the three answer faces (fold, lines, record stream) share one mutex-guarded session state
//! gist resident session — the warm, in-memory search engine (ADR-352 rung 2.5).
//!
//! A `ResidentSession` owns the corpus bytes + trigram index for one repository,
//! held warm across many queries so an eligible request (`request.zig`) answers
//! without re-paying the process + index-mmap + candidate-read startup the cold
//! subprocess pays every call. It lowers each request through the shared search
//! core (`engine/query.zig`) — the SAME compile → trigram-prefilter → match
//! kernels the cold CLI is built on — driven directly over the warm corpus, so
//! the warm and cold answers cannot drift. Because that core **returns errors**
//! (`error.Unsupported`) instead of calling `die()`, a bad request surfaces here
//! as `error.Stale` (→ cold fallback) and can never terminate the daemon — the
//! exact hazard ADR-352 defers the C FFI on.
//!
//! ## The corpus is a faithful mirror
//!
//! Base docs load through `mirror.zig`: full reads (no cap), BOM/UTF-16 decode,
//! whole-body first-NUL offsets, empty docs dropped — the same per-file ingest
//! a cold run applies. Binary docs are ADMITTED (cold does not skip a walked
//! binary; it searches up to the buffer that revealed the first NUL), and each
//! mode applies cold's own binary rule at answer time:
//!
//!   - `files` (`-l`): match only within complete buffers before the NUL one
//!     (`grepfile.handleBinary`'s files_only policy).
//!   - `count` (`-c`): an implicit binary file is suppressed entirely.
//!   - `lines` (bare `gist <pattern>`): emit pre-NUL-buffer matches + WARNING,
//!     rendered by `render.zig` through the cold Emitter itself.
//!   - `search` (FFI record stream): a doc cold `--json` would skip (its 8 KiB
//!     `isBinary` window) is skipped, keeping the record stream byte-identical.
//!
//! ## Read-your-writes: a fail-closed reconcile barrier
//!
//! The invariant is `resident matches == gist --no-index matches == rg matches`.
//! It holds because both the base corpus and every reconcile re-derive their file
//! set from the cold path's OWN certified walk (`commands/ripgrep/run.zig::
//! defaultFileSet` — hidden-file exclusion, `.gitignore`/`.ignore` precedence,
//! `.git` skip, root scope), never `haystack`'s coarse superset. The warm set is
//! therefore byte-identical to what a rootless `gist <pattern>` would walk:
//!
//!   - A query is answered from resident bytes directly ONLY when the freshness
//!     barrier proves the roots quiescent since the last reconcile — a
//!     watcher-clean window (`markClean`/`markDirty`, driven by inotify on Linux
//!     / FSEvents on macOS; `src/session/watch.zig`). This is the microsecond path.
//!   - Otherwise (no watcher, any pending event, first query) the session
//!     RECONCILES: it re-walks the authoritative set and diffs it against
//!     base + overlay — a path that left the set (deleted, or newly
//!     hidden/ignored) is tombstoned; a new path is read in; a known path whose
//!     mtime/ctime advanced past the freshness cursor is re-read — then answers
//!     over (base ∪ overlay) − tombstones. Fail-closed: a rebuilt index
//!     (`pair.gen` drift), a reconcile allocation failure, or a WALK ERROR (an
//!     unreadable directory — cold reports it and exits 2, so a warm answer over
//!     a silently gapped set would lie) surfaces as `error.Stale` and the daemon
//!     declines, so the client falls back to the certified cold path. (A
//!     catastrophic OOM inside the shared walk itself exits the daemon via
//!     `die()`; the client's dropped connection then falls back cold and the
//!     next query re-spawns a fresh daemon — fail-open too.)
//!
//! Queries are serialized by `mutex`; the watcher only ever touches the atomic
//! `dirty_seq`/`clean` pair, never the overlay, so the barrier is a lock-free
//! seqlock over a mutex-guarded engine.
