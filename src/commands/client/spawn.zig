//! gist resident client — best-effort daemon auto-spawn (ADR-352 rung 2.5).
//!
//! The warm path only pays off if a daemon is actually running, but an agent's
//! reflex is a bare `gist <pattern> -l` with zero setup — nobody runs `gist
//! serve` by hand. So when an *eligible* query finds no daemon listening, the
//! cold CLI fires one off detached and then answers this query cold as usual:
//! the current call pays the cold walk, every subsequent eligible query within
//! the daemon's warm window is served from RAM (~in-memory latency, no per-query
//! tree walk — on macOS the FSEvents watcher even elides the reconcile).
//!
//! It is a pure accelerator, exactly like the watcher: any failure (fork/exec
//! error, unsupported target, a peer that won the race) is swallowed and the
//! query still runs cold. Correctness never depends on the spawn succeeding.
//!
//! Herd-safety is the daemon's job, not ours: ~10 coworker CLIs can each fork a
//! `gist serve` at once, but `serve.run`'s advisory `flock` admits exactly one —
//! the losers exit immediately without touching the socket (see `serve.zig`).
//! We only avoid the obviously-wasteful spawn when a daemon is already up.
