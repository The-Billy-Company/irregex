# `src/kernel/rank/` — T4 definition-first ranking

Turns the verified match set into the ranked, token-compressed list an agent
actually wants: the one line that answers the question first, not 200
identical call sites. This is the shape `rg` cannot express — `gist --rank`.

## Files

| File          | Job                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `rank.zig`    | Weighted **Reciprocal Rank Fusion** (Cormack et al. 2009) over the signals below; emits `path:line [def\|use\|gen\|mirror] ×n <line>` |
| `signals.zig` | Language-agnostic byte features: `declarationConfidence` (structural decl detection), `isGenerated` (codegen demotion), `shapeFingerprint` (normalized match-line geometry for rarity) |
| `mirror.zig`  | Cache/VCS snapshot classification, byte fingerprints, exact canonical-duplicate resolution                                            |

## Signals

- **Lexical density** — more occurrences ⇒ more relevant.
- **Definition boost** — structural confidence that the match is a declaration,
  not a use site (three-level: body/value > signature > use).
- **Shape rarity** — normalized match-line geometry devalues repeated
  call/import shapes below rare explanatory shapes.
- **Shallow path** — fewer segments ⇒ closer to a package root.
- **Authored boost** — sinks codegen (`*_pb2.py`, `*.sql.go`, …) and
  cache/VCS mirrors below hand-written code (weighted to outrank their
  inflated lexical + def scores).
- **Class-split, tie-aware** — ranking stays neutral _within_ each class so
  you never invent a total order the signals don't support.
- Exact duplicate mirrors name their canonical result instead of flooding
  the list.

## When to edit

New intrinsic signals, class labels, or RRF weights. Do not put walk or
emit logic here — rank consumes an already-verified hit set from
`kernel/match/` + `surface/exec/cold/view/ranked.zig`.
