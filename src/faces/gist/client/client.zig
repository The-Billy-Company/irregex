//! gist resident client — the CLI's warm fast path (ADR-352 rung 2.5).
//!
//! `attempt` is the thin, fail-open bridge between the bare `gist <pattern>`
//! front door and the resident daemon: it classifies the argv, and only when the
//! request is one the warm path can answer *byte-identically to cold* does it
//! dial the socket, run the query, and emit the result in the exact shape the
//! cold engine would. Anything else — an ineligible argv, no daemon listening, a
//! `decline`, any wire hiccup — returns `.cold`, and the caller runs the
//! certified cold path unchanged. The daemon never becomes a new source of truth
//! or a new failure mode; it is a pure accelerator that can always be skipped.
//!
//! Parity scope: `-l`/`--files-with-matches` (the sorted path list) and the
//! default `lines` search (bare `gist <pattern> [-n]`, whose `path:[line:]text`
//! bytes the daemon pre-renders through the cold Emitter itself) are routed
//! warm. Per-file bytes and the exit code are identical to cold; the FILE
//! emission order is the deterministic `pathLess` canonicalization of cold's
//! parallel worker-discovery order — the same convention warm `-l` has always
//! used, and the equivalence the rgsuite oracle certifies (`sort_lines(gist)
//! == sort_lines(rg)`). `-c` (per-file `path:count`) and every richer shape
//! stay cold: the daemon speaks `count` on the wire as a corpus-wide total for
//! embedders, but the CLI never claims rg's per-file `-c` layout from it.
//!
//! Two environment guards keep the warm answer inside its parity envelope:
//!
//!   * **TTY stdout → cold.** An interactive cold run adds ANSI color and the
//!     16 KiB long-line cap (`--color auto` + the TTY `max_cols` default); the
//!     daemon renders the PIPED frame only. Agents and pipes — the entire warm
//!     workload — are unaffected.
//!   * **Readable stdin → cold.** A rootless query with data on stdin is a
//!     STREAM search in the cold engine; the daemon's tree corpus can never
//!     answer it. Same fd-type rules as cold (`run.readableStdin`), checked
//!     only after a daemon connection exists so the common no-daemon path
//!     never pays the FIFO poll.
