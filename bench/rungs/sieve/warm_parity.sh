# gist WARM prefilter parity — the adverse guard for giving the resident session
# the cold tier's pruning stack (the conjunctive cover plan + the crest sieve).
#
# The warm tier used to ask the index exactly one question: the flat OR of the
# sound prefilter literals (`CompiledQuery.prefilter`). Cold has asked two
# stronger ones for a while — the CNF cover plan (`kernel/query/cover.zig`) and
# the crest sieve over per-doc ρ(d) (`kernel/math/crest.zig`) — so a
# literal-free class repetition like `[0-9a-f]{8}` had NO prunable trigram warm
# and the session scanned 100% of the corpus for it.
#
# Both new prunings are necessary conditions, which means strictly more elision —
# and a prefilter that elides one file it should have read is the worst defect a
# search tool can ship: silent, total, and indistinguishable from "no match".
# So this gate asserts the only property that matters, over the REAL corpus, on
# four arms per case:
#
#   warm   gist <case>                    (resident daemon, stack on)
#   base   gist <case> → base.sock        (a 2nd resident daemon, pre-wiring)
#   live   gist --no-index <case>         (no index at all — the semantic oracle)
#   rg     rg <case>                      (third-party oracle)
#
# All four must produce the same line multiset. `warm` vs `base` isolates the two
# new prunings on ONE binary (no build confound); `live` is the semantic ground
# truth, and the transitive proof that warm ≡ cold without both paths having to
# trust a shared index a coworker may rebuild mid-run; `rg` keeps gist's own
# paths from agreeing on a shared bug.
#
# The baseline is a SECOND DAEMON, not a client-side env var. Both stand-down
# knobs are read where the pruning is derived — `gather.winnowFor`, inside the
# resident session — so exporting them on a client that gets served warm changes
# nothing at all and the baseline arm would silently be a copy of the warm arm.
# Two sockets, two resident sessions, one binary.
#
# The case list is the axis list, not coverage theater — each exercises a
# distinct stand-down in `gather.winnowFor` / `gather.asked`:
#
#   -i            caseless stands the COVER down (the Unicode-fold bounds live
#                 once, in `caselessVariants`) but keeps the sieve
#   -F            a fixed string is not regex source: `cq.source` is null, so
#                 BOTH stand down and the literal path is untouched
#   -P            PCRE2 denotes the pattern under a foreign grammar: `cq.source`
#                 is null there too, and neither pruning may fire
#   -w            word only narrows the match set, so both stay fully sound
#   -v            invert walks every doc; `candidateIds` is a positive superset
#                 there, so a pruned doc must still report its non-matching lines
#   --no-unicode  the ASCII reading, where `\d` is 10 bytes and both fire
#   sieve-*       literal-free class repetitions — the class the trigram index
#                 concedes entirely and the sieve exists for
#   cover-*       patterns forcing several literals, where the plan beats the OR
#
# The corpus is REAL host source, copied into a throwaway tree and indexed
# there. The copy is the point: ~10 agents edit this branch concurrently, and a
# repo-wide arm takes long enough that two IDENTICAL runs already disagree.
# Freezing the bytes is what lets a difference between arms mean something.

# gist's ~25k-token agent-context output budget clips a repo-wide result; a
# clipped arm would read as lost lines rather than as a cap. Lift it (the hard
# OOM ceiling stays on) so all four arms are compared at full output.
