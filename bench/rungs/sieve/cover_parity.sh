# gist conjunctive-cover parity — the adverse guard for wiring the CNF planner
# (`src/kernel/query/cover.zig`) onto the PRODUCTION query path.
#
# The cover is a strictly stronger necessary condition than the flat OR of
# extracted literals it replaces: where `trigramFilter` can state one
# disjunction, a plan states everything the pattern forces. Strictly stronger
# means strictly more elision — and a prefilter that elides one file it should
# have read is the worst defect a search tool can ship, silent and total.
#
# So this gate asserts the only property that matters, over the REAL corpus
# rather than a synthetic one, on FOUR arms per case:
#
#   cover    gist <case>                     (indexed, plan on — the wired path)
#   flat     GIST_NO_COVER=1 gist <case>     (indexed, the pre-wiring flat OR)
#   live     gist --no-index <case>          (no index at all — gist's own oracle)
#   rg       rg <case>                       (third-party oracle, where comparable)
#
# All four must produce the same line multiset. `cover` vs `flat` isolates the
# planner; `live` is the semantic ground truth (the index may only change
# speed); `rg` keeps gist's own two paths from agreeing on a shared bug.
#
# The case list is chosen for the axes that can actually break the wiring, not
# for coverage theater — each one exercises a distinct branch of
# `gate.coverPlan` / `elide.askIndex`:
#
#   -i          caseless stands the cover down (`caselessFilter` keeps the
#               Unicode-fold bounds); proves the stand-down is not a silent drop
#   -U          multiline reaches the plan through `arm.linearOptions`
#   -F          fixed strings are not a regex and must stay on the literal path
#   -e A -e B   multi-pattern folds to `(?:a)|(?:b)`; the plan must be the UNION
#   -P          PCRE2 gets no plan (dual-grammar hazard) and must not lose lines
#   --no-unicode  the ASCII reading, where `\d` is 10 bytes and the cover fires
#   winners     one pattern from each class the cover measurably improves
#
# The corpus is REAL Billy source (thousands of tracked Go/Zig/TS/Markdown
# files), copied into a throwaway tree and indexed there. The copy is the point:
# ~10 agents edit this branch concurrently, and a repo-wide arm takes long enough
# that two IDENTICAL runs already disagree — measured, not assumed. Freezing the
# bytes is what lets a difference between arms mean something.
#
# Usage: bench/sieve/cover_parity.sh
set -uo pipefail
# gist's ~25k-token agent-context output budget clips a repo-wide result; a
# clipped arm would read as lost lines rather than as a cap. Lift it (the hard
# OOM ceiling stays on) so all four arms are compared at full output.
