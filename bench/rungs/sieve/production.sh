# `indexq` measures the planner against csearch's on a shared index: the right
# instrument for "is this filter better", the wrong one for "does a user get
# it". This measures the wired path itself — `gist <pattern>`, the same binary a
# user runs — on two axes:
#
#   candidate bytes   read out of `elide.assemble` AFTER the crest subtraction
#                     (`GIST_CANDIDATE_BYTES`), so it is the oracle's real final
#                     candidate set, not the trigram answer alone.
#   end-to-end wall   best-of-N of the whole process: argv, index load, plan,
#                     posting decode, walk, read, match, emit, exit.
#
# Both arms are the SAME binary — `GIST_NO_COVER=1` stands the planner down —
# so an A/B cannot be confounded by a build difference.
#

# Candidate bytes + docs for one arm, straight out of the wired path. `worth=0`

# rows before this line existed. It affects only this probe: `wall` below times
# the real asynchronous path, unset.
