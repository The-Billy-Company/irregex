# gist CLI-shape admission matrix — measured

_gist cold-indexed vs ripgrep over the six Billy source roots. A WIN needs a lower median **and** Mann-Whitney p < 0.05 (fail-closed). Parity is correctness-proven separately (`matrix.py parity`: gist-idx == gist-noidx == rg). Every shape is a declared win — the former `-U` losses fell to the parallel multiline DFA and the former backref parity to the PCRE2 shadow gate; a future declared `loss` would stay report-only in its own row so no aggregate can bury it._

## Standing requirement — the literal set must span the needle space

`select` names the **prefilter's signal**, not the match count: `selective` (a
discriminating rare byte exists, so a healthy offset selector finds a good pair),
`degenerate` (every byte ties on corpus rarity, so a marginal-rarity selector has
no signal at all), `head-rare` / `tail-rare` (exactly one rare byte, at a known
end). `rare` / `common` are the legacy match-volume labels, kept because committed
floors key on those ids.

This dimension exists because **the suite could not distinguish prefilter failure
from true-match volume.** The literal kernel picks two byte offsets of the needle
to filter 64-byte blocks on, and that selection collapsed to the adjacent pair
`(0,1)` for any needle whose bytes all tied on rarity — which is most lowercase
identifiers. Measured cost: **18.1 GB/s literal scan where 35.5 GB/s was
achievable** on code, **13.1 vs 33.4 GB/s** on prose; in the shipped binary
`stepSec` (7 B, 464 true matches) ran **41% slower** than `pgxpool` (7 B, 8856
true matches) — vastly more real work, less time. Every literal probe was labelled
`rare` or `common`, so two things went unseen: **`pgxpool` was an
unrepresentatively lucky needle** for the rare class (`pg` is a genuinely rare
digraph, so it selects well and looks fast) and stood in for the whole class; and
the degenerate needles that *were* present (`error` here, `func` in the scanner
lane) had their slowness charged to having many true matches rather than to the
prefilter collapsing.

**Therefore the literal probe set must always contain a degenerate, low-match
case** (`literal-degenerate-files`, needle `stepSec`) paired with a length-matched
well-selecting control (`literal-selective-control-files`, needle `pgxpool`), plus
the same-class runs over the classes that tie (lower / upper / digit /
punctuation) and the `head-rare` / `tail-rare` pair that exposes end bias. A
degenerate low-match needle is the only probe whose slowness has a single possible
cause: there is no true work to blame it on. **A future edit that drops these rows
is a coverage regression, not a cleanup.**

One honest limit: the cold-indexed lane above **cannot see the timing defect** —
the trigram index elides most of the corpus for a low-match needle, so the scan
kernel barely runs (trap/control measured 1.04 indexed vs 1.00 un-indexed). The
timing isolation runs in the no-index scanner lane (`races/scanner.sh`,
`SELECTOR_PROBES`); what these rows earn here is **parity**, because a selector
that picks the wrong offset pair is a correctness bug before it is a speed bug.
