# gist enumeration determinism-under-cap oracle.
#
# `equality.sh` proves gist ≡ rg on the FULL (uncapped) matching-file set. This
# gate proves the sibling invariant it can't see — the one the enumeration
# exemption (`corpus.exemptSoftCap`, `Opts.enumeration`) exists to guarantee:
# with the DEFAULT ~25k-token soft context cap ON, the compact per-file modes
#   -l / --files-with-matches · -c / --count · --count-matches ·
#   --files-without-match · --files
# return the COMPLETE, run-to-run-stable set — never a soft-cap-truncated,
# work-stealing-order-dependent SUBSET (the bug that had `gist -l foo` yield a
# different file set each invocation, breaking caching and agent reproducibility).
#
# Two falsifiable assertions per mode, both over the DEFAULT cap (no env budget —
# an explicit GIST_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS would suppress the exemption by contract):
#   1. COMPLETE   — default-cap set == GIST_UNCAP=1 set (the cap drops no file).
#   2. STABLE     — three back-to-back default-cap runs are byte-identical as a
#                   sorted set (no nondeterministic subset under truncation).
#
# The test is non-vacuous by construction: a positive control first proves the
# cap is genuinely LIVE on this corpus — a NON-exempt content mode (default line
# search) truncates (capped ⊊ uncapped) — so "enumeration stayed complete" is a
# real exemption, not a corpus too small to ever trip the guard.
#
# Runs the cold work-stealing engine (`GIST_NO_AUTOSERVE=1` + `--no-index`): that
# parallel walk+read+scan fan-out is where the order-dependent truncation lived,
# and skipping the index keeps the gate hermetic + free of coworker index churn.
# The warm client applies the identical `exemptSoftCap` in `tryWarm`, so the two
# engines cannot disagree on which files `-l` returns.
