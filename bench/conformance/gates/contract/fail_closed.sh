# Fail-closed benchmark-wrapper contract gate.
#
# Race/certificate timers must force complete output (ugrep's `-l` short-circuits
# when a harness sends stdout straight to /dev/null) without masking status.
# `compete_hyperfine` uses hyperfine's own `--output=pipe` sink and ignores ONLY
# rg's no-match exit 1. An unknown flag, crash, bad regex, or unreadable path
# (exit >= 2) therefore aborts the cell. This gate pins that contract:
#
#     exit 0  -> match          (valid, timed)
#     exit 1  -> no match       (valid, timed)
#     exit >= 2 -> hard failure (the benchmark MUST surface it, never time it)
#
# `run_drained` pins the pure exit contract. The sourced production helper also
# proves each gist cell file-set-equivalent to official rg before timing, and its
# real hyperfine configuration is exercised when that tool is installed.
