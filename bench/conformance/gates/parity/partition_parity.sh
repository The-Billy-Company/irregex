# corpus-partition parity — the permanent guard for `--docs` / `--code` / `--data`.
#
# The Zig suite proves the CLASSIFIER: `genus_test.zig` walks every glob in the
# 223-row type table and checks each one lands in the genus its row declares. That
# is a statement about spellings. It cannot make the statement an agent actually
# relies on, which is about a TREE:
#
#   every file the walk produced belongs to exactly one genus, and asking for one
#   genus returns neither less nor more than that.
#
# The distance between those two is where a real regression lives. A type row
# added without a genus, a doc-location rule that stops promoting, a `--no-`
# polarity that drifts from its positive — each one leaves `genus_test` green and
# silently drops files from `--docs`. That is the same failure class
# `patterns_corpus_parity.sh` exists for, and it is worse here: an agent that
# greps the paper trail and gets 90% of it has no way to notice.
#
# So this gate asks gist about gist, over the live corpus, per needle:
#
#   TOTAL        docs ∪ code ∪ data  ==  the unfiltered answer
#   DISJOINT     every pairwise intersection is empty
#   COMPLEMENT   --no-X  ==  unfiltered − X, for each genus
#   ALIAS        -t X == --X   and   -T X == --no-X
#   INDEX-BLIND  armed == stripped: the index may elide reads, never decide the set
#   WARM≡COLD    a resident daemon answers byte-identically to a fresh process
#   NEVER UNHIDES no genus surfaces a path the unfiltered walk refused (.git/ etc.)
#
# Two non-vacuity floors, because every check above would pass against a much
# stupider classifier:
#   * all three genera must claim files, or "total and disjoint" is trivially true
#     of a partition that puts everything in one bucket;
#   * at least one EXTENSIONLESS path promoted by location or name (docs/, man/,
#     CHANGELOG) must land in docs — that rule is the whole reason this axis beats
#     a hand-assembled `-t` union, and it is the first thing a refactor loses.
#
# Self-referential on purpose: no ripgrep column. rg cannot express this axis
# (its type globs are basename-only, so a `docs/` rule is not writable there), so
# there is no oracle to borrow — the invariants ARE the specification.
