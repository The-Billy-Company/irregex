# gist index-elision parity — the permanent guard for the unified engine's core
# safety claim: the persisted trigram index is an ACCELERATION structure only,
# never a semantic one. `gist <pattern>` uses the index solely to elide *reading*
# files the live walk already found but that provably can't match (see
# `src/exec/cold/engine/serial.zig` `IndexSkip`); the walk stays the sole
# authority on the file set, ignore semantics, and per-file output. So for every
# query, the index-accelerated run MUST have the same byte-exact line multiset as
# `--no-index` (a full live read of every walked file). The parallel engine
# intentionally streams worker-discovery order, so independent runs compare the
# line multiset (C-locale sorted, duplicates retained), not incidental cross-file
# scheduling order. This gate proves exactly that — the differential twin of
# `scan_regress.sh` (which proves the live scan
# ≡ rg) and rgsuite (which proves the walk ≡ rg): here the oracle is gist's own
# `--no-index` path, so "the index only changes speed, never results" is
# continuously verified, not merely asserted (sins.mdc: truth, not vibes).
#
# Hermetic: builds a throwaway corpus under one of gist's indexed roots (`libs/`
# so `gist index`'s default_roots covers it), indexes it, then diffs auto-index
# vs --no-index across a battery of modes — INCLUDING a post-index edit, to prove
# the freshness overlay (`corpus/fresh.zig`) closes the stale-index gap (a file
# that GAINS the needle after the build is still found, no false negative).
#
# `gist index` also emits the content shard (`corpus/index/content/shard.zig`),
# so the same oracle covers it for free: `--no-index` forces the pure live walk
# (shard OFF), while the auto run serves unchanged files from the shard mmap —
# the 2-byte-literal `shard-*` cases below are the full-scan classes with no
# trigram prefilter, where every matching file rides the shard, and
# `shard-freshness` proves a post-index edit defeats a stale shard slice.
#
# Usage: bench/gates/index_elision_parity.sh
set -uo pipefail
# Lift gist's default soft output cap so the auto-index vs --no-index diff sees
# identical full output (the hard OOM ceiling stays on).

# the filesystem journal proves nothing changed since the build anchor, which
# lets the walk drop per-file clocks entirely and list names-only — a different
# set of syscalls reaching a different freshness decision path for EVERY file.
# `GIST_NO_JOURNAL=1` refuses the proof and restores the per-file clock walk, so
