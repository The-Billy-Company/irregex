# gist phantom-walk parity — the permanent guard for the `tree.map` snapshot's
# safety claim: the persisted directory-membership snapshot
# (`src/corpus/index/phantom/treemap.zig`) is an ACCELERATION structure only. It
# answers "which names live in this directory" for a directory whose own clocks
# prove its membership unchanged, and it answers NOTHING about file content. So
# for every query, a phantom-served run MUST have the same byte-exact line
# multiset as the same run with `GIST_NO_PHANTOM=1` (every directory listed
# live). The parallel engine streams worker-discovery order, so independent runs
# compare the line multiset (C-locale sorted, duplicates retained), not
# incidental cross-file scheduling order.
#
# `GIST_NO_PHANTOM` was introduced as the escape hatch "for parity gates" and no
# gate consumed it; this is that gate. It is the differential twin of
# `index_elision_parity.sh` (oracle: `--no-index`) with the snapshot as the
# subject instead of the trigram index.
#
# Two branches must both be exercised, because the walk CHOOSES between them per
# directory on cost (`descent.zig` `servePhantomDir` vs `phantom_stat_budget`): a
# snapshot-served entry carries no timestamps, so when the walk wants clocks each
# admitted file pays its own `lstat`, and that only undercuts the live listing it
# replaces while the admitted count stays under the budget.
#
#   * the `broad-*` cases admit every child, so the walk declines the snapshot
#     and lists live — parity here is the guard that declining is invisible;
#   * the `glob-*` cases admit ~one child per directory, so the snapshot serves
#     and the per-file `lstat` recovers the clocks — parity here is the guard on
#     the phantom path proper, and `glob-content-edit` below is its adverse case.
#
# The freshness cases are the ones that matter most. A directory's mtime/ctime
# move on MEMBERSHIP change only (POSIX: create/unlink/rename of a direct
# child), NOT on a child's content being rewritten in place. So a content edit
# leaves the directory provably "unchanged" and still phantom-servable — and the
# needle it just gained may only be found because the admitted file's own clocks
# were read live. `glob-content-edit` fails the moment that per-file freshness is
# dropped, which is precisely the false negative the snapshot could otherwise
# manufacture.
