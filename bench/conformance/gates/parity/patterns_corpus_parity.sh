# relate patterns corpus parity — the permanent guard for the multi-pattern
# surface's contract: `relate patterns` is a DROP-IN for N sequential `gist -l`
# runs, so it must answer over the same population.
#
# This is the relate-side twin of `index_elision_parity.sh`. That gate proves
# the trigram index is an acceleration structure for `gist`, never a semantic
# one — the walk stays the sole authority on the file set. `patterns` used to
# violate exactly that law from the other direction: it took its POPULATION from
# the corpus loader (`corpus/tree/corpus.zig`, which prunes the generic
# VCS/build/vendor basenames via `haystack.isSkipDir`) instead of from the
# rg-parity walk. Measured before the fix: `relate patterns -F -e graphify`
# reported 145 files where `gist -F -l graphify` reported 616 — every one of the
# 471 missing files under `scripts/vendor`, silently, on a verb whose entire
# purpose is EXACT per-pattern attribution.
#
# That pruning is right for the kinship verbs and deliberately left alone:
# `similar`/`echoes`/`pack` are statistical, and a vendored tree should not
# dominate compression scores. It is wrong for an exact verb. So `patterns` now
# walks through `quarry/walk.zig` — literally the enumerator `gist` uses — and
# consults the index only to elide READS.
#
# The gate therefore asserts, per pattern:
#   relate patterns -F -e P --by file   ==(file set)==   gist -F -l P
# both with the index armed and with it stripped (empty GIST_DIR), because an
# index must never be able to change which files answer. At least one case must
# resolve under a `isSkipDir`-pruned directory (`scripts/vendor`), or the gate
# fails as vacuous — that is the exact blind spot it exists to keep closed.
