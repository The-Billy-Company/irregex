"""gist ⇄ ripgrep differential proof for the walk/order/ignore flags rgsuite can't mine.

`run.py` replays ripgrep's *own* mined suite, but that suite exercises almost no
`--sort`/`--sortr`/`--sort-files`, `-j`/`--threads`, `--one-file-system`, or
global-`core.excludesFile` behavior — the results depend on file *timestamps*,
*device ids*, worker *thread counts*, and a user's *global git config*, none of
which a self-contained mined replay can pin. This is the hand-authored companion
that certifies exactly those flags now that gist implements them, with ripgrep as
the ground truth (no hardcoded expected strings):

  * ordering flags are proven **byte-for-byte** on a fixture whose modified /
    accessed times are deliberately shuffled out of path order, so a comparator
    that ignored its key would diverge;
  * negation / one-file-system / global-ignore cases are pinned deterministic by
    pairing them with `--sort path`, so the assertion is byte-exact, not a set;
  * `-j`/`--threads` is proven order-invariant (gist -j1 == gist -jN) and a set
    match against rg (the parallel walk streams in worker-discovery order);
  * the `\\A`/`\\z` **haystack-anchor** lane is proven here across every output
    frame at once. The mined suite carries only r1878's four `\\Abaz` cases, and
    they answer one question — did `-U` pick rg's whole-buffer searcher? — on one
    body shape. What actually breaks is broader: the model choice is invisible in
    the plain frame but shows up as a match tally in `-c`, a column in
    `--vimgrep`, and a line set in `-v`, and `\\z` additionally turns on whether
    the body's last line is terminated. So this lane crosses three tail shapes
    with seven frames, and names the two shapes still short of rg rather than
    omitting them (`_ANCHOR_NULLABLE_HELD_OUT`, `_ANCHOR_EMPTY_AT_EOF`);
  * the `--no-messages` / `--no-ignore-messages` **stderr** lane is proven here
    because the mined suite structurally cannot: rg's own `--no-messages` cases
    assert on the exit code, which a gist that merely *rejected* the flag would
    also satisfy (both exit 2). Suppression is only real if stderr goes empty
    while stdout and the exit class do not move;
  * every non-thread case also asserts the indexed path equals `--no-index`
    (read-elision soundness), and the whole slate runs once per **engine** — the
    parallel work-stealing walk and the serial fallback (`GIST_NO_PARALLEL=1`) —
    because they own separate walk/ignore code (see rgsuite README, "Two engines").

stdlib-only. Fixtures are generated into a temp dir each run (the generator here
is the committed contract), so nothing large or machine-specific is tracked.

# match starting at or past the block's end — so this one is discarded, the
# block's match list goes empty, and `StandardImpl::sink` falls through to
# `sink_fast_multi_line`: the block's lines print verbatim, with no column and
# no per-match rows. `rg -U -o -b '\z'` over `aaa` therefore answers `0:aaa`,
# not the empty span at 3. Frames that need no span (plain, both counts, `-l`,
