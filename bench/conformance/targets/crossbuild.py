"""Hermetic cross-building: one frozen copy of the tree, twenty-two artifacts.

~10 agents edit this package concurrently, so a ten-minute sweep will sometimes
compile against a half-saved file belonging to somebody else — and that is
indistinguishable from a portability failure. Measured, twice:

  · the first full sweep scored six perfectly portable targets `unbuilt` on a
    neighbor's `use of undeclared identifier 'pathVerdictFused'`;
  · the second began with a *clean* control and still lost eleven rows to a
    mid-refactor `src/corpus/fresh/sweep.zig`, one of them reading
    literally `file contents changed during update`.

So this module never compiles the shared tree. `snapshot` freezes the package
plus its path dependencies once, and every target is built from those exact
bytes — which makes the sweep hermetic against concurrent edits *and*
reproducible, since all rows describe one recorded digest. `control` then
compile-checks that same snapshot for the host's own triple, so a failure whose
diagnostics also break the host can be scored `tree-broken` (inconclusive)
rather than `unbuilt` (a port gap).
