//! irregex bench — the single, shared probe registry for the Certificate of
//! Optimality. Layer A (`certify.zig`, microscopic cycles/byte) and Layer D
//! (`../lowerbound/lowerbound.zig`, the algorithmic floor) must speak about
//! *exactly* the same regex classes for the certificate to line up
//! class-for-class across layers — so both `@import` this file instead of
//! keeping their own copy. Before this file existed the two arrays were
//! independently hand-maintained "keep in sync" copies (a real drift risk
//! flagged during Layer D's build); importing one definition removes the
//! risk structurally instead of documenting it as acceptable.
//!
//! `../certify/certify.sh` (the macroscopic bash race) necessarily keeps its
//! own copy of these rows — a shell script can't `@import` Zig data —
//! but it is a single, already-documented cross-language boundary, not
//! open-ended drift between two Zig files.

/// One probe per *regex class* the shipped CLI competes on (the "every type of
/// operation" axis). Each names the class so the certificate maps 1:1 to the
/// claim under test.
