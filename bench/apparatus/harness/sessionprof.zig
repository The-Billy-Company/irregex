//! gist bench — per-function micro-profiles for the WARM SESSION tier.
//!
//!   zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast sessionprof  [-- <dirs…>]  [--reps N]
//!                                                 [--baseline <path>] [--gate]
//!
//! `bench -- session` measures the whole persistent-client → daemon product path
//! (socket, frames, dispatch); `certify` measures the cold fresh-process race.
//! Neither can tell you whether a change to ONE warm function moved the needle —
//! the transport and the reconcile walk drown it. This isolates each seam of
//! `exec/session/` over a real corpus, in-process, and times it directly:
//!
//!   * `gatedLineCount`     — the binary NUL-cut body rule, over every mirror doc.
//!   * `query -l` / `-c`    — the fold faces (candidate walk + Accumulator).
//!   * `query -v -l`/`-v -c`— the set-complement invert fold (`gatedMatches`).
//!   * `queryLines`         — the default `path:text` emit through the cold Emitter.
//!   * `queryLinesShm`      — the same bytes, fd-transport lane.
//!   * `search`             — the FFI record stream (the per-line emit walk).
//!   * `renderLines`        — the serial render core, called directly on gathered docs.
//!   * `renderLinesParallel`— the sharded render over the same docs.
//!
//! Every seam is also CHECKED, not just timed: each answer is folded into an
//! FNV-1a digest and the digest is asserted stable across all reps, and the two
//! render lanes (serial vs sharded vs shm) are asserted byte-identical to each
//! other. A refactor that silently changed an answer fails here before its
//! timing is ever reported.
//!
//! `--baseline <path>` reads a previously written report and prints the per-seam
//! delta with a Mann-Whitney verdict, so a "this refactor is perf-neutral" claim
//! is a measurement rather than an assertion. `--gate` makes a `loss` verdict
//! exit nonzero. The report is written to
//! `.local/gist-verify/sessionprof.json`.
//!
//! ## Why it profiles a SNAPSHOT, not the live tree
//!
//! Every seam here runs the session's reconcile, and ~10 coworker agents edit
//! this repo continuously — a live-tree profile silently measures a different
//! corpus every rep, which the answer-digest check catches as `UnstableAnswer`.
//! So the harness freezes its corpus once into a scratch tree outside the
//! repository (`$TMPDIR/gist-sessionprof-corpus`, reused across runs unless
//! `--refresh`) and profiles the session over that. Before/after runs therefore
//! see byte-identical input, which is the only footing on which "this refactor
//! changed nothing" is a claim rather than a hope.
//!
//! ## Why reps are INTERLEAVED and the verdict is corroborated by best-of-N
//!
//! The same ~10 coworker agents also keep this machine at a load average near
//! its core count, and that load drifts over tens of seconds. Profiling seam A's
//! whole rep block, then seam B's, therefore measures the two seams in DIFFERENT
//! load epochs — measured here at up to 5× apparent movement between two runs of
//! byte-identical code. So every rep sweeps ALL seams once (round-robin), which
//! puts every seam in the same epochs and makes the sample sets comparable.
//!
//! Against ambient contention the noise is additive and one-sided, so the sample
//! MINIMUM is the least-contaminated estimator of a seam's true cost — the same
//! two identical-code runs that moved p50 by 1.2–5× held min to within 0.1% on
//! every seam whose work is one self-contained call. A regression therefore has
//! to satisfy BOTH tests: the distributional Mann-Whitney verdict says `loss`
//! AND best-of-N moved by more than `min_corroboration`. Either alone is noise
//! on a loaded box.
//!
//! Best-of-N still can't see a SUSTAINED tax — a run where every rep is slower
//! because the box is busier for the whole run. So each seam declares a `Class`
//! (single-threaded `scan` vs thread-per-shard `fanout`) and the harness profiles
//! a frozen CALIBRATOR per class: harness-owned work no refactor can touch, in
//! the same shape as the seams it stands for (the fan-out one reproduces the
//! product lane's exact `parallel.shardBounds` geometry). `compare` divides each
//! seam's best-of-N ratio by its class's calibrator, so the reported `norm r`
//! answers the only question that matters — did this seam slow down by more than
//! the machine did at that kind of work? Two classes rather than one because
//! measurement showed a bandwidth probe holds `scan` to 1.4% while leaving
//! `fanout` swinging 2.5×: they contend for different resources.
