"""gist certify — Layer L report (index quality head-to-head against csearch).

Reads the `indexq.tsv` emitted by `zig build indexq` (`bench/sieve/indexq.zig`)
and, optionally, the `indexcost.tsv` emitted by `bench/sieve/indexcost.sh`, and
splices a self-contained **Layer L** section into CERTIFICATE.md between stable
sentinel markers, idempotent across re-mints.

Layer L answers one claim and only that claim: *"your trigram index is
csearch-class, not better."* csearch (Google Code Search, Russ Cox 2012) is
gist's acknowledged trigram ancestor, and the honest axis for comparing two
indexes is not wall time — which confounds the index with the walk, the IO and
the matcher — but **filter quality**: candidate bytes admitted per query, and
the precision of what is admitted. The harness holds everything but the boolean
formula fixed (one corpus, one built index, one evaluator, one verifier) and
lifts csearch's own formula verbatim out of `csearch -verbose`, so the two
planners are compared and nothing else is.

**Fail-closed.** This reporter refuses to splice a win it cannot substantiate:

  * gist must admit **strictly fewer** candidate bytes than csearch in total
    over the measured slate;
  * gist must not **regress** on any single class (never admit more than
    csearch anywhere) — a total that hides a loss is not a win;
  * every arm must have verified the **same hit count** per class (the harness
    already exits non-zero otherwise; re-checked here so a stale TSV cannot
    launder an unsound run);
  * where `indexcost.tsv` is supplied, gist's index must be within
    `MAX_SIZE_RATIO` of csearch's and its build within `MAX_BUILD_RATIO` —
    selectivity bought with a pathologically bigger or slower index is not a
    better index.

Any of those failing exits non-zero and writes nothing.

stdlib only.
