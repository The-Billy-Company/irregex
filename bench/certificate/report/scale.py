"""irregex certify — Layer J report (index tiers at scale, vs zoekt and csearch).

Layer D measures the information-theoretic floor a **trigram** directory can reach,
and records classes arriving at **cand% = 100%** — the whole corpus admitted, because
the needle is thinner than a trigram (`literal-punct2` = `})`) or carries a branch
that is (`regex-litalt` = `panic|0x`). A floor you meet by reading everything is not
a filter. This layer certifies three things, each from its own measured side-car:

1. **the substring (sliver) tier** — `zig build scale` → `scale_tiers.tsv`, in Layer
   D's own unit (candidate BYTES delivered to verify), over the certificate corpus;
2. **scale** — `bench/sliver/scale_race.py` → `scale_race.tsv` / `scale_build.tsv` /
   `scale_resident.tsv` / `scale_truth.tsv`, racing this engine against zoekt and
   csearch over a multi-GB corpus of shallow clones (linux, llvm, go, rust);
3. **the positional tier, measured and DECLINED** — `positional_pareto.tsv`, the
   size/benefit surface over (block-position coverage threshold × per-document cap).

**Fail-closed in all three directions, including the one where the answer is "no".**
The sliver audit must show every truly-matching document surviving the filter. The
scale race must show this engine complete against the correctness-matched indexed
rival and winning the classes this layer's own tier exists to close. And the positional
*decision* is gated too: if the Pareto surface ever shows a cheap threshold that buys
a real reduction, the "declined" narrative below becomes false and this reporter
refuses to splice it — so the honest "no" cannot rot into an excuse.

stdlib only.

#     Layer J makes, and it admits no tolerance.

#     walk's ignore/binary heuristics), not an index defect. It is ceilinged and must

# path it walked in the immortal per-worker arena, twice per entry, and the certificate
# went on quoting the pre-fix figure for a whole release because the number lived in
# prose nobody re-derived. Rendering it from the artifact fixed the staleness; only a
# ceiling fixes the silence, because a regression would otherwise render as a larger
# number in a well-formed table and splice.
#
# Set to catch the regression it exists for, not to pin the current measurement. The
# per-entry arena growth this guards against measured 6.0x when it was live; the fix
# lands between 0.69x and 1.79x depending on the tree. It is deliberately not tighter
# than that, because the denominator is another engine: rg's own walk footprint moves
# 3.5x across the two real corpora on record (31.8 → 110.4 MiB), so a ratio pinned
# near the worst observation would fault on corpus shape rather than on a defect.
#
# Absence is not a fault — a checkout with no committed artifact mints a narrower
# Layer J, the same posture every optional artifact here gets. The guard binds the
# measurement that IS on record; it does not compel one to be taken.
