"""irregex portcert — Layer B certificate splicer (static port-optimality bound).

Reads the `portcert.json` emitted by `mca.sh` (per probe x reference
microarchitecture: Block RThroughput, bytes/iter, cycles/byte) and renders a
`## Layer B — port-optimality (static µarch bound)` markdown section, then
splices it into the artifact home's `CERTIFICATE.md`.

The section also carries **Layer B′ — the port bound measured on this
machine**: if a sibling `portbound.json` exists (written by
`zig build portbound`, which times the
same drift-guarded probes natively under the PMU), its measured cycles/byte +
cycles/step are rendered with full provenance (CPU brand, QoS, meter). This is
fail-closed: without that file — or when it says `"pmu": false` — the
certificate states plainly that cycles are cross-checked against reference
cores only, NOT measured here, and names the rung that mints the measured
figure. Wall-clock is never converted to cycles via an assumed frequency.

Splice discipline (mirrors the face package's bench/certificate/report/stats.py):
replace any existing `## Layer B` section (from that heading to the next
`## Layer` heading or EOF), and insert a fresh one *before* the macroscopic
Layer-A header so re-running `certify.sh` (which rewrites from that header to
EOF) never clobbers Layer B. If CERTIFICATE.md doesn't exist yet, write a
standalone section file and tell the operator to run `zig build certify` first.

stdlib only. Idempotent.
